Tried client-side puck movement
	too much data validation required, example:
		if the player's paddle collided with the puck at roughly the same X position, that client's puck would get stuck moving in-between the screen edge and paddle.
		whereas on the other client's screen, the puck would be in a different position.
	I decided that this was too expensive a problem to solve and have made the puck movement and collision checking on the server.

Tried optimising the data collection of the names, position etc of both clients from the server.
	I tried to reduce the number of calls the client made to the server for pre-game data.
	This caused issues where one client would get stuck in retrieving the data and after a while decided that the performance increase was not worth the work effort.

Implemented a "please wait" screen.
	This was because client 1 wouldn't display the name of player 2 unless player 1 waited until player 2 had connected to the server.

Puck would only move when player pressed a key.
	Caused by SFML sockets being set to blocking mode by default. Fixed this by setting the blocking mode to false.
	This could be used as an interesting/alternative game mode similar to Super Hot.
